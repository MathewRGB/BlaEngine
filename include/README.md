# BlaEngine Public API

This folder includes the headers of the C++ public API of the system.

## Doxygen

Keep in mind that we use doxygen for documeting and publishing our API. That's why the
documentation style have to be different to the rest "///" - docs will be parsed by doxygen
and "//" will NOT parsed by doxygen!
